## Installing the qdt package into MAX

Regardless of the OS, the installation of a MAX package is the same: decompress the zip file according to your OS
and make a copy of the **qdt** folder inside of the directory **MAX 8/Packages**.

Once this is done, the external `qdts.solver` should be able to be called from MAX
as any other MAX object.
